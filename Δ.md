This repository is mainly centered around the writing `boxes labels questions and answers`; however, the ChatGPT conversation where the introduction to the text was created (visible in the repository README file on the main page as well) is also quite interesting.. The initial part is where an introduction was created (most of it anyway), however at one point it shifted into a curious analysis of concepts or themes that elude straightforward explanation, inviting readers to explore and interpret the ambiguity. However, from that point on, it mirrored the original text quite well. The conversation is accessible in the file [OMEGA](./Î©.md), and is linked to in the acknowledgements section of the readme (and [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67b03058-1810-8012-962c-b6546533d65a)). The analysis becomes quite abstract but then converges at the end, into an approximation for the base of a prompt intended for any question. The prompt is accessible in the file [alpha](./Î±.md).

Here is a set of waystonesâ€”or cairns (even PYRAMIDS, if you prefer; cairns are essentially tiny pyramids)â€”to guide the way. After that there is further reflection.

You can use the find function (**Ctrl+F**) and insert the phrase to quickly locate the referenced part of the text

These selected phrases, beyond merely guiding you, also embody significant thematic or reflective checkpoints throughout the text.

```
speak
```
> Some definition of who might appreciate the thing and all of it, and who might not. Although I will not define any absolutes as there is no one true way, we are all diverse.

```
can you?
```
> The structured model used to critically analyze the original writing can be found just above this phrase
> Just below the phrase the original text is described very well, in just four lines, for anyone who wants to get a quick breakdown before trying to comprehend the original text.

```
apply critical thinking to my own message
```
> Where I ask ChatGPT to analyze its analysis of my original text using the same structured model as it used to analyze the original text. (The second analysis)

```
I find it
```
> At the end of the second analysis, Â I find ChatGPTs reflections on its reflections quite fascinating. ðŸ˜†
> Plus, just below, I ask it to analyze its analysis of its analysis of the original text. (The third analysis)

```
level 4+
```
> Just after the third analysis, where we decided to not overdo the meta level analysis. This specific line suggests why.

```
discussing the meaning of meaning
```
> At the start of the answer to a deep research prompt. An essay that is not an essay but an attempt at a meta-question for questioning to find the meaning of meaning in the meaning of whatever follows. 
> Basically just an attempt to create a base for a meta-question that can be used as a prompt that can be added to at the end to define the topic.

```
I think i love it
```
> This line asks if this is the meta-question prompt, and if so then it defines my attitude towards it.
> Below it is ChatGPTs answer evaluation on whether this is the mega-question prompt.

## Reflections on this whole creating waystones thing.

Because the analysis is extensive, at some point, I began identifying interesting phrasesâ€”unique combinations or arrangements of words and symbols. Using the find function (**Ctrl+F**), each selected phrase reliably directs you to the exact section of the text I intended. I semi-consciously ended up picking phrases that made sense on their own. Later, I added one more phrase to help readers locate the part of the text that loosely defines the audience most likely to appreciate the whole piece (though I avoid making absolute assumptions).

After finding the lines, placing them in a text file, I was a bit dumbfounded as only then I realized (I am not kidding) that the lines I had picked and in the order they were placed also formed meaning as a whole. And quite a bit more ridiculously, the meaning was a reflection of my attitude to the whole thing.

I ended up posting the thing on a social media account where I post events, moments and thoughts in my life that are highly significant to me but the posts are written to be stripped of all context that can analyze my personal context (though I am quite devious, as some of them are intended to make people assume they can figure out a connection to me). So to document that here. If anyone finds that poem on that social media, even if it appears to have any meaning, it was made without any intention or intention of meaning. I think I love it.

The post looks like this:

Later, when I decided I wanted to help people determine whether they might find themselves in an audience that would enjoy this whole thing before digging too deep, I added an `arrangement of symbols` for that purpose as well and made the post:
