# Boxes and labels and questions and answers.

## Introduction

This work was originally written between January 30th and February 1st, 2023â€”a series of thoughts logged in real-time while I was in a state of high cognitive overload, bordering on (if not fully) a psychosis-like state. I've observed a psychosis-like state where a person can hold multiple realities as equally true or not false at the same time, fundamentally disconnected from a single reality. Curiously, I've also seen this described as an attribute of exceptionally successful leaders. *It seems this may be judged based on factors like status and role*. During this time, I was immersed in deep reflection, questioning the very nature of questions, seeking answers about answers, while simultaneously sorting and labeling at least three semesters' worth of university materials into boxes. All of this was while also processing after effects of trauma from a couple of years prior. This process led me down a rabbit hole of thought, prompting profound reflections on the meaning of words, the purpose of labels, and how we categorize and structure our understanding of the world.

I initially published this elsewhere for a brief period but quickly moved it to a private space due to its abstract nature and the potential to alienate a general audience in that setting.

Despite this, I remain incredibly fond of this pieceâ€”not only because of the circumstances under which it was created but also because of its deep exploration of **language**, **communication**, **meaning**, **interpretation**, and **diversity of experience**. It captures something fundamental about how we organize thoughts, both physically and mentally.

The text is composed of three separate posts, each written in response to the previous one. Their titles, in sequence: **"Boxes," "Labels,"** and **"Questions and Answers."** Together, they form a kind of gestaltâ€”each part interwoven into a larger, evolving exploration.

### **For consideration:**

The writing begins as a chaotic, disjointed narrativeâ€”perhaps even nonsensical at timesâ€”but as it progresses, patterns emerge. Around the midsection, a more coherent structure starts to take hold, and by the end, the ideas converge into structured reflections on learning, communication, and the role of choiceâ€”concluding with open-ended speculation on how technology might shape our ability to define and navigate meaning.
